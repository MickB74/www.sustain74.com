                <p>Climate change demands an "all of the above" strategy. Renewable energy, efficiency, electrification, new technologies, and carbon pricing all have vital roles to play. But there is one essential tool we cannot afford to neglect: <strong>nature itself</strong>.</p>

                <p>Forests, wetlands, peatlands, grasslands, and oceans are not just victims of climate change — they are powerful allies. Protecting and restoring ecosystems offers immediate, scalable, and cost-effective ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions while delivering co-benefits like biodiversity, water regulation, and community resilience.</p>

                <h2>Why Nature-Based Solutions (NCS) Matter</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scale and speed</strong>: Protecting existing forests and restoring degraded land can begin delivering carbon benefits immediately. Unlike some engineered technologies, these solutions are available now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple co-benefits</strong>: NCS strengthen biodiversity, safeguard water supplies, and provide disaster resilience — outcomes that engineered solutions rarely deliver alone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong>: Nature-based solutions are often cheaper than industrial alternatives when factoring in ecosystem services and avoided damages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptation and resilience</strong>: Healthy ecosystems buffer storms, floods, droughts, and heat — protecting communities worldwide.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why This Matters for Companies</h2>

                <p>For the private sector, clarity in rules and standards is essential. Companies rely on these signals to design strategies, allocate capital, and communicate credibly with customers and investors. Whether it's setting Scope 3 supplier requirements, committing to RE100, or purchasing carbon credits, firms need frameworks they can trust. Standards bodies must also take this into account — designing rules that are science-based, practical, and aligned with the pace of corporate decision-making.</p>

                <p>But here's the key: we don't have the luxury of waiting for <em>perfect systems</em>. If rules, standards, or crediting mechanisms are still evolving, businesses should not delay. These are rarely top-priority decisions in most companies, so every delay or shift in opaque rules only adds friction — and risks losing patience at the C-suite level. Waiting for flawless policy design risks paralysis, while the climate clock doesn't stop. As the saying goes: <em>don't let perfect be the enemy of the good.</em></p>

                <p>By acting now with available tools — including credible nature-based solutions — companies can reduce risk, stay ahead of regulation, and build resilience into their operations. Imperfect progress today is far better than delayed perfection tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>A Complementary Path Forward</h2>

                <p>Some fear that investing in nature-based solutions will distract from decarbonization through energy and industry. The reality is the opposite: NCS and technology complement each other. Clean power reduces future emissions. Nature removes carbon already in the atmosphere. Together, they provide redundancy, resilience, and fairness.</p>

                <p>We cannot engineer our way out of the climate crisis alone. Nor can nature shoulder the burden without systemic decarbonization. But by valuing ecosystems properly — through incentives, carbon markets, direct financing, and policy alignment — we unlock one of the most powerful and immediate levers for action.</p>

                <h2>The Call to Action</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Policy makers and standards setters</strong>: Embed NCS explicitly into national climate commitments (NDCs), and design standards that are science-based, practical, and predictable. Companies depend on this guidance — it is not their core business to design carbon accounting rules or navigate shifting frameworks on their own.</li>
                    <li><strong>Philanthropy and finance</strong>: Fund the research, monitoring, and scaling needed to mainstream nature's role in climate action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Citizens</strong>: Advocate for nature to be treated as essential infrastructure in the climate fight.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Nature is not optional.</strong> It is indispensable. The signatures from institutions like <a href="https://www.nature.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Nature Conservancy</a>, <a href="https://www.edf.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDF</a>, <a href="https://www.conservation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conservation International</a>, <a href="https://drawdown.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Drawdown</a>, <a href="https://www.unep.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNEP</a>, and many others prove the momentum is here. The scientific consensus is clear: we cannot afford to rule out nature from climate action — and neither can companies shaping their future strategies.</p>

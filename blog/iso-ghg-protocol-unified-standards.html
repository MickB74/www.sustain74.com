      <h2>What Happened</h2>
      
      <p>On September 9, 2025, <strong>ISO</strong> (International Organization for Standardization) and the <strong>GHG Protocol</strong> (by WRI & WBCSD) announced a <strong>strategic partnership</strong> to harmonize their greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and reporting standards.</p>
      
      <p>Key points from the agreement:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Their existing GHG standards (ISO's 1406X family + GHG Protocol's Corporate, Scope 2, Scope 3 Standards) will be combined into <strong>harmonized, co-branded international standards</strong>.</li>
        <li>They will also co-develop a <strong>joint product carbon footprint standard</strong> to meet demand for more granular emissions data across value chains.</li>
        <li>The aim is to produce a <strong>common global language</strong> for emissions accounting, to simplify reporting, improve consistency, reduce confusion / duplication, and better support decarbonization efforts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Challenge Before</th>
            <th>What the Unified Framework Offers</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Multiple overlapping standards (ISO vs GHG Protocol) with sometimes differing terminology, verification guidance, or boundary definitions.</td>
            <td>A single, co-branded standard reduces ambiguity and could reduce the need for organizations to translate or adapt reports for different frameworks.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Fragmented metrics across corporate, product, and project-level accounting.</td>
            <td>Harmonization across all levels (corporate / product / project) will allow more consistent measurement and comparability.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>High burdens in gathering Scope 3 / value chain emissions data, due to lack of alignment or varying methodologies.</td>
            <td>A shared standard for product carbon footprints + aligned methodology for Scope 3 interpretation can simplify and strengthen data validity.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Regulatory / investor expectations using different references.</td>
            <td>With unified standards, regulators, investors, auditors will have clearer, more consistent references. Helps reduce risk of misalignment.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>What's Changing & What's Transitional</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Co-branded standards</strong>: The upcoming standards will bear both ISO and GHG Protocol marks.</li>
        <li><strong>New / merged documents</strong>: Future standards will merge elements from ISO 1406X series and from key GHG Protocol standards (Corporate Accounting & Reporting; Scope 2; Scope 3).</li>
        <li><strong>Product-level standard</strong>: A joint product carbon footprint standard is being developed.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification / assurance processes</strong>: Presumably, verification guidance will be harmonized, but many details (how audits or verifications will transition) are still in work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Organizations Should Do Now</h2>
      
      <p>While full implementation details are still being developed, companies and institutions preparing for the transition can start positioning themselves to adapt smoothly:</p>
      
      <h3>1. Map current practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify how your organization currently uses ISO 14064 / other ISO 1406X standards and/or GHG Protocol standards (for corporate, product, scope 2/3).</li>
        <li>Note gaps, overlaps, mismatches in terminology, boundary definitions, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2. Strengthen Scope 3 / value chain data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Because product carbon footprinting and more granular value chain emissions are central to the new combined standard, start improving data collection, supplier engagement, estimation methods where needed.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Review verification / audit arrangements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Talk to your third-party verifiers / auditors about how they will adapt to the unified standard.</li>
        <li>Ensure that your data systems and documentation are robust, traceable, transparent.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>4. Watch regulatory alignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitor how this unified framework is referenced or required by emerging regulations (e.g. EU CSRD, ISSB, other jurisdictional climate disclosure rules).</li>
        <li>If your organization reports across jurisdictions, anticipate which standard references may change.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>5. Engage in feedback / working groups</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ISO and GHG Protocol are likely to form technical committees / working groups to finalize standards. Organizations that can contribute can help ensure usability and relevance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Potential Risks & Things to Watch</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weaker rules risk</strong>: Harmonization should not mean watering down requirements. Some stakeholders warn that merging needs to preserve rigor.</li>
        <li><strong>Transition period complexity</strong>: For a time, organizations may need to maintain compliance/reporting against older standards while shifting to the combined one.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost and capacity issues</strong>: More detailed value-chain / product-level accounting may create resource burdens, especially for small / midsize firms.</li>
        <li><strong>Governance & transparency</strong>: It's crucial that development processes remain inclusive, with inputs from a wide range of stakeholders (SMEs, developing country perspectives, civil society) so that the standards are usable and fair.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implications for ESG / Sustainability Professionals</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The unified standard is likely to become a <strong>de facto global baseline</strong> for GHG accounting and reporting. Being ahead of the curve gives a competitive / reputational advantage.</li>
        <li>Integrated frameworks make comparing performance across peers, supply chains, sectors easier, improving benchmarking, investor communication.</li>
        <li>Helps simplify audit and assurance work, reducing the overhead of demonstrating compliance with multiple frameworks.</li>
        <li>Push toward more transparency and narrower tolerances for estimation / uncertainty; data quality and rigor will matter more.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      
      <p>The ISO-GHG Protocol partnership marks a major turning point in the carbon accounting landscape. What was once a fragmented set of rules and frameworks is moving toward a unified, coherent set of standards covering corporate, product, and project emissions.</p>
      
      <p>For organizations, the message is: start preparing now. Those who adapt early—strengthening data systems, clarifying internal definitions, engaging in the standardization process—are likely to benefit most.</p>

    <h2>Sample Engagements</h2>
    <div class="case-studies-grid">
      <div class="case-study-card">
        <h3>Mid-Market SaaS Co. – Customer ESG Compliance by 2030</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> A mid-market SaaS provider must meet the ESG requirements of its two largest enterprise clients by December 31, 2030, despite having minimal in-house sustainability expertise.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We performed a gap analysis against each client's ESG scorecard, then launched a supplier-engagement sprint to collect primary data on emissions, labor practices, and waste. We supplemented gaps with industry-standard emissions factors, and stood up a quarterly ESG governance forum.</p>
        <p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> A customer-aligned ESG compliance roadmap with clear milestones through 2030, defined internal roles and processes for ongoing oversight, and secured renewal of both enterprise contracts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-card">
        <h3>Regional Utility – Corporate Clean-Energy Offering</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> A regional power utility wants to design and market a clean-energy solution that appeals to Fortune 500 customers and diversifies its revenue by 2027.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We surveyed top corporate accounts to pinpoint demand for green power (e.g., 100% renewable PPAs, on-site solar), then ran financial and technical feasibility models (CAPEX/OPEX, tariff structures). Finally, we piloted a 10 MW virtual PPA with two anchor clients to validate subscription demand.</p>
        <p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Launch of a 50 MW corporate clean-energy project by Q3 2027, with initial virtual PPA subscriptions covering 20% of capacity, establishing a replicable model for future green-tariff offerings.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-card">
        <h3>Consumer Goods Co. – ESG Peer Benchmarking</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> A consumer goods manufacturer needs to benchmark its ESG performance against the top ten industry peers by Q2 2026 to inform its strategic priorities.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We aggregated and analyzed public disclosures (CDP responses, SASB reports, MSCI ratings) across key metrics—Scope 1–3 emissions, board diversity, water intensity, and governance scores—and created an interactive peer-comparison dashboard. We then facilitated a priority-setting workshop to align leadership on target areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> A dynamic dashboard highlighting relative strengths and gaps, identification of the top three focus areas (e.g., Scope 3 reduction, board composition, water stewardship), and an action plan with specific targets and timelines to reach peer-leading performance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-card">
        <h3>Sales Team – ESG Solutions Sales Enablement</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Equip a B2B sales force to effectively position and sell ESG-based products and services by deeply understanding the priorities and decision-drivers of corporate buyers.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          <li>Conduct "Voice of Customer" interviews with 15 procurement and sustainability leaders at target accounts to map key ESG motivations (e.g., regulatory compliance, brand differentiation, investor expectations).</li>
          <li>Develop a modular sales playbook that aligns ESG value propositions to each driver, with tailored talking points, case snippets, and ROI calculators.</li>
          <li>Deliver a 2-day interactive training workshop—including role-plays, objection-handling clinics, and live coaching—reinforced by a quarterly "Lunch & Learn" refresher series.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li>A 25% increase in ESG-solution win rate within six months.</li>
          <li>Sales reps consistently articulate top three ESG drivers and link product features to customer priorities.</li>
          <li>A scalable, updateable sales toolkit that supports ongoing onboarding and new product launches.</li>

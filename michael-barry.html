                    <p class="subtitle">Michael Barry brings over 15 years of leadership in corporate sustainability, having led Bloomberg LP's clean energy and ESG strategies. His work secured renewable electricity across operations, launched global decarbonization initiatives, and established Bloomberg's early alignment with RE100 and the GHG Protocol. He combines real-world sustainability execution with fluency in ESG data and AI tools—helping clients bridge ambition and action.</p>

            <section class="story-content" aria-label="Our Story">
                <p>My success at Bloomberg crystallized my vision for Sustain74: to bring data-driven rigor and AI-powered efficiency to every company, not just a select few. Drawing on over 15 years of hands-on ESG and renewable-energy expertise—including designing Scope 1 and 2 reduction strategies, automating regulatory submissions, and architecting sustainability data pipelines—I've seen firsthand how machine-learning models in ESG data ingestion, intelligent peer benchmarking, and predictive risk analysis can transform raw disclosures into dynamic diagnostics. Sustain74 bridges the gap between fragmented information and decision-ready insights, enabling companies to confidently engage and sell to ESG professionals. Today, our platform empowers organizations to scale those first wins—turning ESG from a compliance checkbox into a strategic accelerator for growth, innovation, and genuine environmental impact.</p>
                
                <p>Along the way, I've partnered with sales leaders and product teams who believed in sustainability but found their tools and processes weren't quite up to the task. I watched proposals stall when data was unreliable, demos fall flat when insights lacked context, and investment decisions hinge on spreadsheets that never captured the full picture. I kept wishing I could step in, streamline their workflows, and equip them with the AI-powered capabilities they needed to close deals and exceed targets. That frustration—and the drive to solve it at scale—ultimately led me to build Sustain74, so every sales and product team can win with confidence and clarity on ESG.</p>

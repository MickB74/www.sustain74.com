                    <p class="subtitle">Michael Barry brings over 15 years of leadership in corporate sustainability, having led Bloomberg LP's clean energy and ESG strategies. His work secured renewable electricity across operations, launched global decarbonization initiatives, and established Bloomberg's early alignment with RE100 and the GHG Protocol. He combines real-world sustainability execution with fluency in ESG data and AI tools—helping clients bridge ambition and action.</p>

            <section class="story-content" aria-label="Our Story">
                <p>My success at Bloomberg crystallized my vision for Sustain74: to bring data-driven rigor and AI-powered efficiency to every company, not just a select few. Drawing on over 15 years of hands-on ESG, renewable-energy, and clean-technology expertise, I've seen how the right projects—solar, wind, green hydrogen, and efficiency upgrades—move from novel ideas to widely accepted standards when backed by rigorous data and peer benchmarks.</p>

                    <li><strong>Technology Adoption Insights</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Analyzed which clean-energy solutions deliver ROI in different sectors</li>
                            <li>Benchmarked project performance against industry "best in class"</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Data Architecture</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Built scalable pipelines to ingest and normalize renewables project data</li>
                            <li>Automated KPI tracking for plant output, capacity factors, and carbon offsets</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Machine-Learning Benchmarking</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Automated peer comparisons to pinpoint performance gaps and emerging trends</li>
                            <li>Identified which technologies are gaining traction across regions and industries</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>User-Focused Insights</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dynamic dashboards that clarify which clean-energy options your stakeholders trust</li>
                            <li>Actionable recommendations on where to invest for fastest payback and market acceptance</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Along the way, I partnered with sales and product teams wrestling with fragmented clean-energy data—uncertain which technologies peers were actually deploying, and which would meet customer or investor expectations. I saw proposals falter when benchmarks lacked context, and projects stall without clear evidence of what "works" in practice. That tension—and the drive to solve it at scale—led me to build Sustain74, so every organization can move from hypothesis to high-confidence decisions on clean energy, turning ESG from a compliance checkbox into a strategic accelerator for growth, innovation, and genuine impact.</p>
                
                <p>After hearing countless pitches stumble over jargon and shallow metrics, I designed Sustain74 to give your sales and product teams true ESG fluency. They'll be able to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speak the ESG lexicon</strong>—from materiality to double materiality, TCFD to ESRS—so every conversation feels expert-led</li>
                    <li><strong>Translate data into impact</strong>—framing benchmarks and KPIs in the terms investors, regulators, and procurement professionals value</li>
                    <li><strong>Tell the story that matters</strong>—weaving sustainability outcomes into your value proposition, so you move beyond features and into shared purpose</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With Sustain74, your team won't just sell—they'll connect, inspiring confidence and forging partnerships built on a shared sustainability language.</p>

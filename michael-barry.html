                <h3>Internal ESG Strategy</h3>
                <p>If you’re leading an internal ESG program, I know the challenges you face—because I’ve been there. From navigating incomplete or inconsistent data to aligning multiple departments with shifting regulatory and customer expectations, it’s easy for even strong programs to stall before reaching their full potential.</p>

                <p>New disclosure rules, supplier program demands, and evolving stakeholder expectations require more than a compliance checklist. They demand a team that can clearly articulate your program’s value, understand where your gaps lie, and confidently plan for what’s coming next—whether that’s new Scope 3 supplier requirements, changing incentive structures, or shifting investor priorities.</p>

                <p>After years leading ESG strategy inside complex organizations, I built Sustain74 to give internal ESG teams the clarity, tools, and confidence they need to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>See the full picture</strong> – Benchmark against peers, suppliers, and customer requirements to pinpoint your biggest opportunities and risks</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove your value</strong> – Turn technical ESG data into compelling narratives that resonate with C-suite leaders, employees, and external stakeholders</li>
                    <li><strong>Anticipate change</strong> – Track emerging policies, frameworks, and supply chain requirements to stay ahead of risk and ready for opportunity</li>
                    <li><strong>Accelerate impact</strong> – Use AI-enabled diagnostics to focus on the highest-impact levers, from renewable sourcing to reporting rigor</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With Sustain74, your ESG team won’t just manage compliance—they’ll lead the conversation, shape strategy, and drive results that matter to your organization and its stakeholders.</p>
                <h3>ESG Product Development</h3>
                <p>If you’re developing products to help companies meet their ESG targets, my deep experience on the other side of the table enables me to quickly identify what your sales team needs to succeed.</p>
                
                <p>New ESG products, evolving tariffs, and innovative program ideas can be challenging to communicate to ESG professionals—each with their own frameworks, priorities, and ways of thinking. Your team must understand not only what a customer or stakeholder is doing today, but what they should be doing, and how potential changes in policies, incentives, or supplier programs might affect them. Without that fluency, even the best ideas can be lost in translation.</p>
                
                <p>After hearing countless pitches stumble over jargon and shallow metrics, I designed Sustain74 to give sales and product teams true ESG fluency. They’ll be able to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speak the ESG lexicon</strong> (from materiality to double materiality, TCFD to ESRS) so every conversation feels expert-led</li>
                    <li><strong>Translate data into impact</strong>, framing benchmarks and KPIs in the terms investors, regulators, and procurement professionals value</li>
                    <li><strong>Tell the story that matters</strong>, weaving sustainability outcomes into your value proposition so you move beyond features into shared purpose</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With Sustain74, your team won’t just sell—they’ll connect, building trust, inspiring confidence, and forging partnerships grounded in a shared sustainability language.</p>
